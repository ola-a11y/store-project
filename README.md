## 🌟 Key Features

* **Shopping Cart (Built with Context API):**
    * A complete cart system was built using **React Context API** for global state management.
    * **Add to Cart:** (Functionality implemented).
    * **Quantity Management:** The cart recognizes similar items (using a unique `id`) and groups them, with the ability to increase (`+`) or decrease (`-`) the quantity.
    * **Remove From Cart:** Items can be completely removed from the cart.
* **Persistent Cart:**
    * The cart state is saved to **`localStorage`** to ensure items are not lost on page refresh.
* **Dynamic Product Filtering:**
    * Products can be filtered by category (All, Skin Care, etc.) using React state.
* **Responsive Design (From Scratch):**
    * The site was built to be 100% responsive across all screens (mobile, tablet, and desktop) using Tailwind CSS.
* **Accessibility (a11y) Implemented:**
    * (Accessibility standards were applied during development).
